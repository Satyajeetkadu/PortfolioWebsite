				<blockquote>"Talent without hard work is nothing‚Äù- Cristiano Ronaldo </blockquote>
					<p>The only thing that has not changed about me since i was 10, is my love for football.  </p>
					<p>I began playing football when I was quite young, and I fell in love with it the moment the ball touched my feet.</p>
					<p>Throughout my school years, I played for my school team as well as with my friends in my building; playing this sport still brings me the same joy that it did when I was younger.</p>
					<p>I was a big fan of Cristiano Ronaldo since the beginning, mainly because I was inspired by his dedication, passion, and work ethic for the sport and his dreams.</p>
                    <p>Don't get me wrong, I still think Messi is quite good, but nothing can convince me that Ronaldo is the GOAT.</p>
					<p>I am also a fan of the Red Devils, also known as Manchester United, and watching them play still gives me goosebumps.</p>
                    <p>This sport has taught me not only how to play in a team, but also how to stay disciplined and focused on your goals.</p>
