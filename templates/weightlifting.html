				<blockquote>"No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.‚Äù- Socrates </blockquote>
					<p>Growing up i was always the small weak kid amongst my friends and peers from school, and somehow i got used to being like this lazy,unproductive and weak.  </p>
					<p>In the beginning of the pandemic i wasted much time playing video games, eating junk and not exercsing at all, that led me to being in the worst shape of my life.</p>
					<p>So I made a change to my lifestyle and decided that i will start working out ,eat clean and learn about it as well, through the internet.</p>
					<p>I remember spending hours watching fitness videos, nutrition videos and finally after understanding some of it, i started implementing what i had learned.</p>
					<p>In the beginnig it was extremely tough, counting my food intake/calories, then resisiting urges to eat junk,forcing myself to workout even on the days i didn't feel like it</p>
					<p>But once enough time passed by and i started seeing the results, i felt like it was all worth it. Even though i have just begun, I dont feel like stopping now and letting myself fall back onto my old habits.</p>
					<p>I hope this gives someone the motivation and urge to start atleast exercising and staying consistent with it and see the magic it does to yourself...</p>
